#=================================================
# Usage notes:
# - Create a GitHub (if you don't have it) and login
# - Create a new (Personal Access Token) with "read, write repo and workflow" permissions, go to https://github.com/settings/tokens/new to create new token .
# - Copy your token and keep it, because you won't see it anymore.
# - Go to https://github.com/your_username/HelmiWrt-OS/settings/secrets/actions (change your_username with yours).
# - Create new Actions Secrets by clicking "New repository secret" with name "HELMIWRT_RW".
# - Paste your token to "Value" coloumn, then save it with green button under this coloumn.
# - Then you can run this actions.
